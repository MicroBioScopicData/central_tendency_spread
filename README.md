# Python Statistical Analysis: Measures of central tendency and dispersion
Welcome to this tutorial on measures of central tendency and spread with Python. In this tutorial, we will explore the different measures of central tendency, including mean, median, and mode, and how to calculate them using Python. We will also discuss measures of spread, such as range, variance, and standard deviation, and how to calculate them using Python. Throughout the tutorial, we will use practical examples and fictitious and real-world datasets to illustrate the concepts and techniques. By the end of this tutorial, you will have a good understanding of how to use Python to calculate measures of central tendency and dispersion. You will also learn where it is appropriate to use each measure and how to interpret these measures to gain insights into your data.
Measures of central tendency are a key aspect of descriptive statistics, which is a branch of statistics that deals with summarizing and describing datasets in a meaningful way. Descriptive statistics provide a way to describe the essential features of a dataset, such as its central tendency and variability. The three most common measures of central tendency are the mean, median, and mode (Publishing, 2020).
